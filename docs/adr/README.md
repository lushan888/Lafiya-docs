# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture *why* a significant, hard-to-reverse decision was made — not
what the code does. Use this format for a new ADR:

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: Title

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR NNNN

## Context
What problem forced this decision?

## Decision
What was decided?

## Consequences
What does this make easier or harder, and what did we give up?
```

Number ADRs sequentially and never renumber or delete one — supersede it
instead.
