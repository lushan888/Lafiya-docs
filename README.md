**Your vitals, verified. When you can't speak, Lafiya does.**

Lafiya is a free, patient-owned **emergency health card**. The handful of facts that change how you are treated in an emergency — blood group, genotype, allergies, current medications, chronic conditions — travel with you as a scannable QR code, work offline, and can be **cryptographically verified** by a health worker so a first responder can trust them on the spot.

*Lafiya* is Hausa for health, safety, and wellbeing.

<a id="status"></a>

> **Status:** Pre-alpha · Stellar **testnet** · not yet audited · not a medical device. See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Overview

Lafiya pairs a minimal, patient-controlled emergency profile with a Stellar-based trust and payment layer, so the facts that matter in an emergency are both *available* and *verifiable* — without ever putting health data on-chain.

### The Problem

In Nigeria, health records are paper, siloed per facility, and effectively lost the moment a patient moves, is referred, or arrives unconscious. In an emergency, the facts that decide treatment — especially **genotype** (AS/SS sickle-cell status), blood group, and drug allergies — are usually unknown to whoever is treating you. Wrong assumptions cost lives.

This gap compounds in a specific way on the ground:

- **Patients carry nothing portable** — a paper card, if it exists, doesn't survive a move, a referral, or an emergency
- **Responders have no way to trust a claim** — even if a patient states their blood group or allergy, there is no verification a first responder can check under time pressure
- **Community health workers (CHWs) are the last-mile bottleneck** — they are best positioned to register and verify patients, but have no sustainable incentive to do it at scale
- **No existing system is both privacy-respecting and independently verifiable** — paper is unverifiable, and a plain database of health records raises exactly the centralised-honeypot problem regulators and patients are right to worry about

### What Lafiya Does

- **For the patient / mother** — a free card you carry (on your phone or printed) that speaks for you when you can't.
- **For the responder / clinician** — scan the QR, no login, and see only the decision-relevant subset, with a clear "verified" indicator you can trust.
- **For the community health worker (CHW)** — get paid in USDC on Stellar for each person you register and verify, solving the last-mile distribution problem.

## Features

- **Scannable Emergency QR**: a public, read-only page exposing only the decision-relevant subset of a patient's record — works offline, no login required for the responder
- **Patient-Controlled Profile**: the patient (or guardian) owns a private, authenticated profile and chooses exactly what appears on the public page
- **Cryptographic Attestation**: a licensed health worker verifies a record on-chain via Soroban — a hash, the attester's identity, and a timestamp, never the health data itself
- **CHW Incentive Payments**: micro-payments in USDC on Stellar reward community health workers per verified registration, funded transparently on-chain
- **Zero On-Chain PII**: Stellar holds only hashes, attestations, and payments — personal health data lives exclusively in an encrypted, access-controlled off-chain database

### Core Components

- **`lafiya-web`** *(in progress)*: Next.js app hosting both the authenticated profile editor and the public emergency page + QR generation
- **`lafiya-contract`** *(in progress)*: Soroban smart contracts — attestation registry and attester allowlist, Rust, Testnet first
- **`lafiya-docs`** *(this repo)*: concept note, data model, threat model, privacy design, and funding/DPG materials that the other repos are built against
- **`lafiya-verifier`** *(reserved, not started)*: CHW verification tool; starts as a route inside `lafiya-web` and only splits out if it grows

## Attestation & Trust Model

| Concept | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **On-chain attestation** | A licensed, allowlisted health worker verifies a record; Soroban records a hash of the record + the attester's identity + a timestamp |
| **Off-chain data** | The full health record lives encrypted in an access-controlled database, gated by row-level security; it never touches the chain |
| **Verified indicator** | A responder's scan checks the attestation registry for a matching hash and shows a clear "verified" badge |
| **Attester allowlist** | Only registered health workers approved through governance can write attestations |
| **Incentive rails** | CHWs are paid micro-amounts of USDC on Stellar per verified registration; near-zero fees make last-mile outreach economically viable |

### Core design principle

> **No personal health data ever touches the blockchain.** Personal data lives in an encrypted, access-controlled off-chain database. Stellar holds only hashes, attestations, and payments. This is what keeps Lafiya both privacy-respecting and regulator-compatible — and it is why Stellar is a *core* component here, not a database substitute.

### Why Stellar (core, not shoehorned)

Stellar/Soroban does two things Lafiya genuinely needs and that a plain web app cannot: it makes verification **tamper-evident and independently checkable** without exposing data, and it moves **stablecoin micropayments** to health workers cheaply and across borders. Remove Stellar and the trust layer and the incentive engine both disappear.

## Data Model (emergency subset)

The public emergency page is intentionally minimal:

- Name, age, photo
- **Blood group and genotype**
- Drug allergies
- Current medications (esp. anticoagulants, insulin, anti-epileptics)
- Chronic conditions / implants
- Emergency contact(s)
- Language spoken

Everything else (full history, documents, notes) stays private, behind authentication.

## Privacy & Compliance

- **Nigeria Data Protection Act (2023)** governs all personal data held. Consent, encryption, and minimal disclosure are designed in from day one.
- Patients opt into exactly what appears on their public page.
- No health data on-chain; only non-reversible hashes and attestations.

## Repository Structure

This repository (`lafiya-docs`) holds the concept note, data model, threat model, privacy design, and funding/DPG materials for the Lafiya project. The web app and smart contracts live in separate repos — see [Lafiya Organization](#lafiya-organization) below.

## Getting Started

*Pre-alpha.* This repo (`lafiya-docs`) is documentation-only — there is nothing to install or run here. To run the product itself, clone `lafiya-web`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/lafiya-web
cd lafiya-web
cp .env.example .env.local   # Supabase + Stellar testnet keys
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for what "done" means at each milestone.

- **Phase 0 — Documentation foundation.** Done — concept note, data model, threat model, privacy design, ADRs, and contributor infra all live in this repo.
- **M0 — Public card (testnet).** *In progress* — `lafiya-web` (profile, public emergency page, QR) and `lafiya-contract` (attestation + attester registries) are both scaffolded and under active development. One patient will be able to create a profile and expose a working read-only emergency page via QR.
- **M1 — Attestation.** Soroban registry lets an allowlisted attester verify a record; the card shows a verified indicator.
- **M2 — Incentives.** USDC-on-Stellar payout to a CHW per verified registration.
- **M3 — Pilot.** Small supervised field pilot; measure verified cards created and scan events.
- **M4 — Mainnet + funding.** Launch on mainnet; open transparent funding pool.

## Why This Matters

- **For patients** — the facts that decide emergency treatment travel with them, instead of being lost at the clinic door.
- **For responders** — a verified indicator they can trust in seconds, without needing to contact a facility or take a claim on faith.
- **For CHWs** — a sustainable, transparent, per-verification incentive instead of unpaid last-mile work.
- **For funders** — every dollar in the incentive pool maps to a countable number of verified cards, on-chain.

Lafiya is built as an open-source **Digital Public Good** (SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being).

- **Primary:** Stellar Community Fund (SCF) — Build track.
- **Bridge:** Registration against the Digital Public Goods Standard.
- **Later:** DPG-aligned and public-goods streaming funders once real-world impact is demonstrable.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend / app:** Next.js, deployed on Vercel — see [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-nextjs-supabase-stack.md)
- **Data & auth:** Supabase (Postgres, Row-Level Security, encryption at rest) — see [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-nextjs-supabase-stack.md)
- **On-chain:** Soroban smart contracts (Rust) on Stellar; USDC on Stellar for payments — see [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-why-stellar.md) and [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-usdc-for-chw-incentives.md)
- **Standards:** W3C Verifiable Credentials data model; HL7 FHIR for health-data field structure

## Lafiya Organization

This project lives under the `lafiya-xyz` GitHub organization. If a change here touches a shared contract (below), call it out so the matching repo can be updated.

| Repo | Purpose | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`lafiya-web`](https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/lafiya-web) | Patient + responder web app (Next.js). Public emergency page, authed profile editor, QR generation. | **In progress** |
| [`lafiya-contract`](https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/lafiya-contract) | Soroban smart contracts (Rust): attestation registry + attester allowlist. Testnet first. | **In progress** |
| [`lafiya-docs`](https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/lafiya-docs) *(this repo)* | Concept note, data model, threat model, privacy design, funding/DPG materials, references. | Ongoing (lightweight) |
| [`.github`](https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/.github) | Organization profile README and contribution guidelines. | Reserved — placeholder README only |
| [`lafiya-verifier`](https://github.com/lafiya-xyz/lafiya-verifier) | CHW verification tool. Begins as a route inside `lafiya-web`; split out only if it grows. | Reserved — placeholder README only |

> All five repos now exist. `lafiya-web` and `lafiya-contract` are where the real work happens; `.github` and `lafiya-verifier` are intentionally left as reserved placeholders (a one-line README, nothing else) until there's an actual reason to fill them in. Resist scaffolding a placeholder into real code before that reason shows up.

### Where to Start (per repo)

- **`lafiya-web`** — start at its own README, then read this repo's [Data Model](#data-model-emergency-subset) and [docs/api-surface-sketch.md](docs/api-surface-sketch.md) before touching profile or public-page code. Already has authenticated and public route groups, an API layer, and a Supabase integration.
- **`lafiya-contract`** — start at the [attestation record shape](#shared-contracts-must-stay-in-sync-across-repos) below, the [Soroban interface sketch](docs/api-surface-sketch.md#lafiya-contract-soroban-interface-sketch), and [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) for why the trust model looks the way it does. Already has separate attestation-registry and attester-registry crates.
- **`lafiya-docs`** (this repo) — start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md); it's the source of truth every other repo builds against.
- **`.github`** — reserved placeholder repo (a one-line README only); org-wide templates and CODEOWNERS haven't been added there yet.
- **`lafiya-verifier`** — reserved placeholder repo (a one-line README only); CHW verification still lives as a route inside `lafiya-web` (see [Core Components](#core-components)) until there's a reason to split it out.

### Data Flow

                          USDC payout to CHW (on Stellar)
```

1. **`lafiya-docs`** (this repo) defines the emergency data model, threat model, and privacy design that the other repos build against.
2. **`lafiya-web`** implements the patient profile, the public emergency page, and QR generation, following the data model above.
3. A CHW verifies a record; **`lafiya-contract`** records the attestation on Soroban (hash + attester identity + timestamp only).
4. The public emergency page reflects the verified flag once the attestation lands.
5. Verified registrations trigger a USDC-on-Stellar payout to the CHW from the transparent funding pool.

### Shared Contracts (must stay in sync across repos)

- **Emergency data model** — the field list under [Data Model](#data-model-emergency-subset) above is the source of truth; `lafiya-web`'s profile schema must mirror it field-for-field.
- **Attestation record shape** — hash of record + attester identity + timestamp; `lafiya-contract`'s attestation-registry crate must match this shape — check for drift whenever either side changes.
- **Environment/config keys** — Supabase and Stellar testnet keys, defined in `lafiya-web`'s `.env.example` (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)).

### Conventions for AI Agents

- Treat this section as the source of truth for **cross-repo** contracts. Each repo's own README covers repo-local conventions once it exists.
- This repo currently contains **documentation only** — do not assume application or contract code lives here.
- No personal health data, secrets, or private keys belong in this repo, ever — only specs, models, and public materials.
- If a change in one repo touches a shared contract above, say so explicitly and open a matching issue in the affected repo(s) — don't let the repos drift silently out of sync.
- Don't invent URLs, contact details, or people. If a fact isn't confirmed, leave a clearly marked placeholder instead of a fabricated one.

## Disclaimer

Lafiya is an information aid, **not a medical device** and **not a substitute for professional medical judgment**. Verified indicators reflect that a record was attested by a registered health worker; they are not a clinical guarantee. Treatment decisions remain the responsibility of the attending clinician.
